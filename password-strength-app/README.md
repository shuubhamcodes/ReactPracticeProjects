# **Password Strength Indicator App**

This is a simple **Password Strength Indicator** built using **React** and **Vite**. The app evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria, including length, inclusion of numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the basics of React, including state management and conditional rendering.

## **Features**

- **Real-time Feedback**: As the user types the password, its strength is evaluated in real-time.
- **Password Strength Levels**:
  - **Weak**: Less than 6 characters.
  - **Medium**: At least 6 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
  - **Strong**: 10 or more characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The strength is displayed with color-coded text: red for weak, orange for medium, and green for strong.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the app.

## **Concepts Covered**

- **React Functional Components**: The app is built entirely using functional components.
- **State Management**: Uses the `useState` hook to manage the password input and strength.
- **Event Handling**: Uses the `onChange` event handler to monitor user input.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Renders different strength levels based on password criteria.
- **Regex for Validation**: The app uses regular expressions to check for numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuubhamcodes/ReactPracticeProjects.git
   cd password-strength-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Vite development server to run the app locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **View the App**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app in action.

## **Usage**

1. Enter a password in the input field.
2. The app will dynamically evaluate the password strength based on:
   - Length of the password.
   - Whether it contains numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.
3. The strength will be displayed as either **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.

## **Project Breakdown**

### **App Component (`App.jsx`)**

- **State**:
  - `password`: Stores the user input (the password).
  - `strength`: Stores the evaluated strength of the password (Weak, Medium, Strong).
  
- **Functions**:
  - `handlePasswordChange`: Updates the password as the user types and calls `evaluateStrength`.
  - `evaluateStrength`: Uses regular expressions to check for numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters in the password. It also checks the password length to determine the overall strength.

- **UI**:
  - Input field for entering the password.
  - Dynamic message displaying the password strength.

### **Styling (`App.css`)**

- The password strength message is styled based on the strength level:
  - **Weak**: Red.
  - **Medium**: Orange.
  - **Strong**: Green.

## **How the Password Strength is Evaluated**

- If the password is less than 6 characters, it is considered **Weak**.
- If the password is at least 6 characters and contains numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters, it is considered **Medium**.
- If the password is 10 or more characters and contains numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters, it is considered **Strong**.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add more granular password strength evaluation criteria (e.g., checking for dictionary words, password entropy).
- Add tests to validate the password strength evaluation logic.
